                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>I dropped out of high school and worked as a CW / helper electrician for a few years. I
                                moved on in my career to more carpentry / handyman type stuff, and eventually I went to
                                college for math. Well, the white collar job market in 2025 ain't what it used to be, so
                                I ended
                                up looking for work in the trades again.</p>
                            <p>I applied for an electrical apprenticeship, and I was surprised to see that there was an
                                aptitude test with math on it. I was even more
                                surprised to see that the test preparation resources online were all behind a
                                paywall. I didn't know exactly what to expect on the test, but I studied math in college
                                so I
                                decided to wing it. I did well, but I don't want
                                anyone to have a financial barrier to passing their test, so I made this site with my
                                free time.

                            <h6 class="mt-3">Is this site affiliated with the IBEW?</h6>
                            <p>No, this is an independent educational resource. This site is not affiliated with,
                                endorsed by,
                                or connected to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or any official
                                testing organization.</p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">Is this site really free?</h6>
                            <p>Yes! All practice materials and resources on this site are completely free to use. There
                                are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or paywalls. <strong> Donations are not required, but
                                    are greatly appreciated. Donate whatever you think is fair.</strong></p>
                            <h6 class="mt-4">Where are these questions from?</h6>
                            <p>I used
                                an LLM to generate some of the math questions and answers, as well as the reading
                                passages. I also created a lot of them myself. I
                                based the format and question types off of my memory of an aptitude test that I took in
                                2025. I'm not sure if the questions are exactly the same type, but they should be close.
                                I'm confident that
                                if you can perform well on these practice exams, you'll do well on the actual test. </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">What does a typical electrical apprenticeship aptitude test cover?</h6>
                            <p>An aptitude test typically includes two main sections: mathematics and reading
                                comprehension. These practice materials are designed
                                to help you prepare for these areas. Some tests cover additional topics such as
                                mechanical aptitude and spatial reasoning, those topics are not covered on this site.
                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">What is the passing score for the aptitude practice tests?</h6>
                            <p>A score of 60% or higher indicates that you have a good chance of passing your test, but
                                is no guarantee. To my knowledge, the testing bodies do not provide their grading
                                standards so it is impossible for this site to grade you in a similar way. Do your best
                                to get as high of a score as possible on the practice tests and study what you got
                                wrong.</p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">How should I use this site to prepare?</h6>
                            <p>I recommend starting with a full practice exam and mimicking the test environment. To do
                                so, set a timer for 50 minutes for the math portion, and 50 minutes for the reading
                                portion.
                                Take a 10-15 minute break between the two sections.
                                After completing the full practice exam, review the explanations and study the
                                strategies on the <a href="math-help.html">Math Help</a> and <a
                                    href="reading-help.html">Reading Help</a> pages.
                                Then, practice the math and reading sections separately.
                                Finally, take the additional full practice exam to see your progress.

                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">I saw a type of question on the test that wasn't on this site!</h6>
                            <p>Let me know, and I'll add it to the site.</p>
                            <h6 class="mt-4">Is this good preparation for the GAN aptitude test?</h6>
                            <p>I'm not familiar with that test, so I would caution against using this site as a resource
                                to prepare for that test.</p>
