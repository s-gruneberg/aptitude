                            <p>I dropped out of high school and worked as a CW / helper electrician for a few years. I
                                moved on in my career to more carpentry / handyman type stuff, and eventually I went to
                                college for math. Well, the white collar job market in 2025 ain't what it used to be, so
                                I ended
                                up looking for work in the trades again.</p>
                            <p>I took an aptitude test for an electrical apprenticeship and didn't study because all of
                                the materials I could find were paywalled. I managed to pass mine, but I don't want
                                anyone to have a financial barrier to passing their test, so I made this site with my
                                free time.

                            <h6 class="mt-3">Is this site affiliated with IBEW?</h6>
                            <p>No, this is an independent educational resource. This site is not affiliated with,
                                endorsed by,
                                or connected to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or any official
                                testing organization.</p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">Is this site really free?</h6>
                            <p>Yes! All practice materials and resources on this site are completely free to use. There
                                are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or paywalls. <strong> Donations are not required, but
                                    are greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
                            <h6 class="mt-4">Where are these questions from?</h6>
                            <p>I used
                                an LLM to generate the math questions and answers, as well as the reading passages. I
                                based the format and question types off of my memory of an aptitude test that I took in
                                2025. I'm not sure if the questions are exactly the same, but they should be close.
                                I'm confident that
                                if you can perform well on these practice exams, you'll excel on the actual test. </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">What does a typical electrical apprenticeship aptitude test cover?</h6>
                            <p>The aptitude test typically includes two main sections: mathematics (algebra,
                                functions, number series) and reading comprehension. Our practice materials are designed
                                to help you prepare for these areas. Some tests cover additional topics such as
                                mechanical aptitude and spatial reasoning.</p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">How should I use this site to prepare?</h6>
                            <p>We recommend starting with a full practice exam and mimicking the test environment. To do
                                so, set a timer for 50 minutes for the math portion, and 50 minutes for the reading
                                portion.
                                Take a 10 minute break between the two sections.
                                After completing the full practice exam, review the explanations and study the
                                strategies on the <a href="explanations-math.html">Math Help</a> and <a
                                    href="explanations-reading.html">Reading Help</a> pages.
                                Then, practice the math and reading sections separately.
                                Finally, take the additional full practice exam to see your progress.

                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-4">Can I use this on mobile devices?</h6>

                                computers. Since the test is taken on a computer, that's the best way to practice.</p>
