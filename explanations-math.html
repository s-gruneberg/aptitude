                            <h5>How to approach these problems</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I advise you to approach these problems in order of likelihood, the most likely
                                    pattern is addition /
                                    subtraction between adjacent numbers, so start there.</li>
                                <li>Write out the differences / ratios between adjacent numbers and look for a pattern
                                    in those. <strong>Actually writing it
                                        out can help you see patterns.</strong> </li>
                                <li>Addition and subtraction between adjacent
                                    numbers is the most likely pattern you'll see. Start there.</li>
                                <li> If addition and subtraction between the numbers does not yield a pattern, try
                                    multiplication and division between numbers.
                                <li>If multiplication and division fail to reveal a pattern, try taking the square root
                                    or exponent of the numbers (one of the math practice problems uses square roots).
                                </li>
                                <li>If you're still stuck, try looking for a pattern in the numbers themselves. For
                                    example, if the numbers are all prime, maybe it's the next prime number in the
                                    sequence.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Worked examples</h5>
                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Try this pattern:</strong> What comes next in the sequence
                                \(2,\,5,\,9,\,14,\,20,\,\ ?\)</p>
                            <p class="text-muted"><em>Detailed explanation:</em> Compute differences between numbers:
                                \(5-2=3,\ 9-5=4,\ 14-9=5,\ 20-14=6\). Writing out the differences, we get \(3, 4, 5, 6\)
                                and the pattern is more clear.
                                The differences increase by 1 each time, so the
                                next difference should be \(7\). Add it to the last term: \(20 + 7 = 27\). So the next
                                term is \(27\).</p>
                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Try this pattern:</strong> What comes next in the sequence
                                \(3,\,5,\,2,\,6,\,1,\,\ ?\)</p>
                            <p class="text-muted"><em>Detailed explanation:</em> Compute first differences:
                                \(5-3=2,\ 2-5=-3,\ 6-2=4,\ 1-6=-5\). Writing out the differences, we get \(+2, -3, +4,
                                -5\)
                                and the pattern is more clear.
                                The differences increase by 1 each time and alternate signs positive and negative, so
                                the
                                next difference should be \(+6\). Add it to the last term: \(1 + 6 = 7\). So the next
                                term is \(7\). Alternatively, you could see the same pattern by seeing that every other
                                number
                                decreases by 1 (3, x ,2, y, 1) and the other numbers increase by 1 (5, m, 6, n, ?).</p>

                                <li>In my opinion the most reliable way to solve these problems consistently is to graph
                                    them. You can also plug in numbers to check the statements.
                                <li> Don't let weird variables like p and qtrip you up- they are no different than
                                    graphing x and y
                                    equations.</li>
                                <li>First, solve the equation for one variable in terms of the other (usually solve for
                                    the variable on the left side).</li>
                                <li>Pick easy values (like 0, 1, or 2) for one variable and calculate the corresponding
                                    value of the other variable to find points on the line.</li>
                                <li>Plot at least two points to visualize the line's direction and position.</li>
                                <li>Use the graph to test each answer choice by checking if the given conditions make
                                    sense with the line's behavior.</li>

                                <li><strong>Be familiar with types of graphs:</strong> Linear graphs are straight lines
                                    (equations like \(y = mx + b\)). Quadratic graphs are curved (equations with \(x^2\)
                                    terms). <strong>It's only a curved line in a graph if there is an exponent or square
                                        root!</strong></li>
                                <li>Write out statements into formulas accurately. Read carefully: "y is x times itself"
                                    means \(y = x^2\), not \(y = 2x\).</li>
                                <li>Plot 3 points from tables and connect them. If the line curves, it's non-linear.
                                </li>
                                <li>A systematic way to solve: Find three points from the given representation
                                    (statement, table, graph, or function) and check to see if they all exist on each
                                    answer choice. The correct answer will have all three points match.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Worked example</h5>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-center"><strong>Problem statement:</strong> "y is x times itself plus
                                two"</p>

                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Step 1: Convert the statement to a formula</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-2">"y is x times itself plus two" means:</p>
                            <p class="mb-3 text-center">\[y = x^2 + 2\]</p>

                            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Step 2: Find three points to test</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-2">Let's calculate a few points from \(y = x^2 + 2\):</p>
                            <ul class="mb-3">
                                <li>When \(x = 0\): \(y = 0^2 + 2 = 2\), so the point is \((0, 2)\)</li>
                                <li>When \(x = 1\): \(y = 1^2 + 2 = 3\), so the point is \((1, 3)\)</li>
                                <li>When \(x = 2\): \(y = 2^2 + 2 = 6\), so the point is \((2, 6)\)</li>
                            </ul>
