                            <p>The French Revolution, which began in 1789, marked one of the most tumultuous periods in
                                European history. Sparked by widespread discontent with the absolute monarchy of Louis
                                XVI, economic hardship, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas, the revolution would
                                fundamentally reshape French society and politics. The initial phase saw the storming of
                                the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, an event that has since become France's national
                                holiday. This symbolic act represented the people's rejection of royal authority and
                                their determination to claim power for themselves.</p>

                            <p>As the revolution progressed, the National Assembly worked to dismantle the old feudal
                                system and establish a constitutional monarchy. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and
                                of the Citizen, adopted in August 1789, proclaimed that all men were born free and equal
                                in rights. However, these lofty ideals would soon be tested as the revolution took
                                increasingly radical turns. The execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 marked a point of
                                no return, transforming France from a constitutional monarchy into a republic.</p>

                            <p>The period known as the Reign of Terror, which lasted from September 1793 to July 1794,
                                represents one of the darkest chapters of the revolution. Led by Maximilien Robespierre
                                and the Committee of Public Safety, this era was characterized by extreme measures
                                designed to eliminate enemies of the revolution. The guillotine became the primary
                                instrument of execution, and its efficiency made it a symbol of revolutionary justice—or
                                injustice, depending on one's perspective.</p>

                            <p>The guillotine itself was a relatively new invention, having been developed by Dr.
                                Joseph-Ignace Guillotin in 1792. Ironically, Dr. Guillotin had proposed the device as a
                                more humane method of execution, believing it would provide a quick and painless death
                                compared to the brutal methods used previously, such as hanging, beheading by sword, or
                                drawing and quartering. The machine consisted of a heavy blade suspended between two
                                upright posts, which would drop rapidly to sever the head from the body in a single
                                motion.</p>

                            <p>During the Reign of Terror, the guillotine was used extensively in public executions that
                                drew large crowds. Place de la Révolution (now Place de la Concorde) in Paris became the
                                primary execution site, where thousands met their end. The most famous victim was
                                undoubtedly Marie Antoinette, the former queen, who was executed on October 16, 1793.
                                Her death, along with that of her husband Louis XVI, symbolized the complete destruction
                                of the old regime.</p>

                            <p>The efficiency of the guillotine was both its strength and its horror. Unlike previous
                                methods of execution that could be botched or prolonged, the guillotine delivered death
                                almost instantaneously. Contemporary accounts describe the blade dropping in less than a
                                second, with the head separated from the body before most observers could process what
                                had happened. Some witnesses claimed that the severed heads showed signs of
                                consciousness for several seconds after decapitation, though modern medical science
                                suggests this was likely a misinterpretation of reflexive muscle movements.</p>

                            <p>Estimates suggest that approximately 16,000 to 17,000 people were executed by guillotine
                                during the Reign of Terror, though the total number of deaths from the revolution's
                                various forms of violence was much higher. The victims included not only aristocrats and
                                royalty but also common people accused of counter-revolutionary activities. The
                                definition of "enemy of the revolution" became increasingly broad, leading to a climate
                                of fear and suspicion throughout France.</p>

                            <p>The Reign of Terror came to an end with the execution of Robespierre himself on July 28,
                                1794, in what became known as the Thermidorian Reaction. Ironically, the man who had
                                orchestrated so many executions met the same fate he had prescribed for others. His
                                death marked the beginning of a more moderate phase of the revolution, though the
                                guillotine would continue to be used in France for executions until 1977, when capital
                                punishment was finally abolished.</p>

                            <p>The French Revolution's legacy is complex and multifaceted. While it advanced principles
                                of liberty, equality, and fraternity that would influence democratic movements
                                worldwide, it also demonstrated how revolutionary ideals could be corrupted by extremism
                                and violence. The guillotine, intended as a symbol of egalitarian justice, became
                                instead a symbol of state-sanctified murder, reminding us that the tools of justice can
                                easily become instruments of terror when placed in the wrong hands.</p>

                                <p class="text-muted mt-2"><strong>Answer: B</strong> - The context describes a period
                                    marked by revolution, violence, and dramatic changes, indicating disorder and
                                    confusion.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">Tumultous is right at the beginning: "The French Revolution,
                                    which began in 1789, marked one of the most tumultuous periods in European history."
                                    There aren't a lot of clues as to what the word means there, so the best thing to do
                                    is make an informed decision based on the rest of the passage's tone. A and D can
                                    definitely be ruled out, and between B and C, I think B is the better choice.</p>

                                <p class="text-muted mt-2"><strong>Answer: B</strong> - The passage describes the
                                    guillotine as a symbol of "egalitarian justice," and the context of the revolution
                                    emphasizes equality, suggesting "egalitarian" means believing in equality for all.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">For this one I would think back to the guillotine inventor's
                                    intentions-
                                    a more humane method of execution. Since that doesn't give me a whole lot to go on,
                                    I think about the guillotine being intended as a symbol of the revolution and a
                                    justice for the common people-
                                    which leads me to make a best guess that the answer has to do with equality and
                                    justice.</p>

                                    revolution, indicating an informative, balanced purpose.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">A can be ruled out because the passage is not about

                                    not about arguing that executions were necessary. D can be ruled out because the
                                    passage is not about promoting tourism to France. Between B and D, I think B is the
                                    better choice.</p>
