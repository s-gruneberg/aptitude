                                    easier.</li>
                                <li>Read the passage. I sort of skim a little bit, making note of where things are so I
                                    can come back and answer specific questions. It's unlikely I will remember the
                                    answer
                                    from reading it once; I'm reading it so I know where to find the information

                                <li>Sometimes the best way to approach is to eliminate answers that don't make sense,
                                    and then make a best guess from the remaining options- sometimes choices are
                                    ambiguous.</li>
                                <li>Identify the main idea and key points as you read. Loosely figuring out the topic of
                                    each paragraph makes it
                                    easy to come back and answer specific questions.</li>
                                <li>Pay attention to topic sentences and concluding statements</li>
                                <li>Don't rely on prior knowledge - base answers only on the passage</li>
                                <li>At the 1 minute remaining mark, I think it's best to start guessing and make sure
                                    that every question is at least answered.</li>

                            </h6>

                            <p>The French Revolution, which began in 1789, marked one of the most tumultuous periods in
                                European history. Sparked by widespread discontent with the absolute monarchy of Louis
                                XVI, economic hardship, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas, the revolution would
                                fundamentally reshape French society and politics. The initial phase saw the storming of
                                the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, an event that has since become France's national
                                holiday. This symbolic act represented the people's rejection of royal authority and
                                their determination to claim power for themselves through collective action.</p>

                            <p>As the revolution progressed, the National Assembly worked to dismantle the old feudal
                                system and establish a constitutional monarchy. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and
                                of the Citizen, adopted in August 1789, proclaimed that all men were born free and equal
                                in rights. This document, inspired by Enlightenment thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
                                established principles that would become foundational to left-leaning political
                                movements
                                for centuries to come. The declaration challenged the divine right of kings and asserted
                                that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.</p>

                            <p>The working classes of Paris, known as the sans-culottes, played a crucial role in
                                pushing the revolution in more radical directions. These artisans, shopkeepers, and
                                laborers organized themselves into political clubs and neighborhood assemblies,
                                demanding
                                not just political rights but economic justice. They called for price controls on bread
                                and other necessities, limits on property ownership, and greater representation for
                                common people in government. The sans-culottes demonstrated the power of organized
                                working-class movements to influence political change, showing that when workers unite
                                and act collectively, they can challenge even the most entrenched power structures.</p>

                            <p>The Jacobin Club emerged as one of the most influential left-leaning political
                                organizations of the revolution. Originally a moderate group, it became increasingly
                                radical as members like Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat
                                gained influence. The Jacobins advocated for universal male suffrage, the abolition of
                                slavery, and policies that favored the common people over the aristocracy. They
                                established networks of political clubs throughout France, creating a nationwide
                                organization that could coordinate action and spread revolutionary ideas.

                                collective organizing.</p>

                            <p>The period known as the Reign of Terror, which lasted from September 1793 to July 1794,
                                represents a complex chapter in the revolution's history. Led by Robespierre and the
                                Committee of Public Safety, this era was characterized by extreme measures designed to
                                protect the revolution from both internal and external enemies. While the methods used
                                during this period were harsh, the Committee also implemented progressive policies:
                                price controls to help the poor, the abolition of slavery
                                in French colonies, and attempts to redistribute land from the aristocracy to common
                                people.</p>

                            <p>The execution of Louis XVI in January 1793 marked a point of no return, transforming
                                France from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. This act, carried out by the
                                National Convention, demonstrated that the people, when organized and determined, could
                                hold even the highest authorities accountable. The trial and execution were conducted
                                through democratic processes, with elected representatives voting on the king's fate.
                            </p>

                            <p>Women played significant roles in the revolutionary movement, organizing marches, forming
                                political clubs, and demanding rights. The Women's March on Versailles in October 1789,
                                where thousands of women marched to demand bread and bring the royal family back to
                                Paris, showed the power of collective action by those who were officially excluded from
                                political participation. Figures like Olympe de Gouges wrote declarations calling for
                                women's rights, challenging the revolution to live up to its ideals of equality for all
                                people, not just men.</p>

                            <p>The Reign of Terror came to an end with the execution of Robespierre himself on July 28,
                                1794, in what became known as the Thermidorian Reaction. This marked a shift toward more
                                moderate policies, but the revolutionary principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity
                                had already taken root. The revolution had shown that organized people could overthrow
                                centuries of aristocratic rule and establish new forms of government based on popular
                                sovereignty.</p>

                            <p>The French Revolution's legacy for left-leaning politics and labor movements is profound
                                and enduring. It demonstrated that collective action by ordinary people could
                                fundamentally
                                transform society. The principles of equality, workers' rights, and popular sovereignty
                                that emerged from the revolution would inspire labor movements, socialist
                                movements, and democratic struggles for generations. The revolution showed that when
                                workers and common people organize, unite, and act together, they possess the power to
                                challenge entrenched elites and create more just societies. This legacy continues to
                                inspire union organizing and left-leaning political movements today, reminding us that
                                history is made not by kings and aristocrats alone, but by the collective action of
                                organized people fighting for their rights and dignity.</p>

                                    is ruled out because the passage doesn't focus on the guillotine- it focuses on
                                    collective action and organizing. D is ruled out because it's too specific and the

                                    revolution had positive impacts- it brought about democracy and inspired movements.
                                    C
                                    is ruled out because the passage specifically talks about working-class people like
                                    the sans-culottes participating. D is ruled out because the passage explicitly
                                    states
                                    the revolution's legacy "continues to inspire union organizing and left-leaning

                                    progressive policies and the extreme measures as occurring during the same period,
                                    but doesn't claim they are necessarily connected. The passage shows they happened
                                    together but doesn't say one requires the other.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">This is a difficult inference question because the
                                    answer isn't directly stated- you have to think about what the passage implies about
                                    the relationship between policies and methods. A can be ruled out because the
                                    passage doesn't say violence is the ONLY way- it just shows what happened in this
                                    case. C can be ruled out because it's too absolute- the passage doesn't say ALL
                                    progresssive policies require extreme measures. D can be ruled out because the
                                    passage explicitly says the policies helped "the poor" and "common people," not
                                    wealthy people. B is the best answer because it acknowledges what the passage shows
                                    (both happened) without making a claim the passage doesn't support (that they're
                                    necessarily connected). The passage presents them as coexisting but doesn't argue
                                    one
                                    requires the other.</p>

                                    question that also requires you to understand the meaning of the phrase "universal
                                    male suffrage". Suffrage is the right to vote, and based on the desire to implement
                                    universal male suffrage, we can infer that some men could vote but not all of them.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">Choice A can be ruled out because if the goal is universal

                                    suffrage, we can infer that some men could not vote. B can be ruled out because if
                                    the goal was to establish universal male suffrage, that implies that there was
                                    already some voting body present- otherwise they would want just suffrage or some
                                    kind of voting body. D can be ruled out because of the paragraph discussing women
                                    seeking the right to vote. That leaves C as the most likely answer.</p>

                                    that "sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class" and
                                    connects this to the idea that organized people have power, making B the clearest
                                    answer.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">Choice A can be ruled out because the passage states that
                                    sovereignity belonged to the people, not to kings. Choice B sounds pretty good,
                                    substituting that
                                    definition into the passage: ""challenged the divine right of kings and asserted
                                    that supreme power or authority belonged to the
                                    people...." Let's look and see if another choice seems better. Choice C can be ruled
                                    out because it seems weaker than choice B. Choice D can be ruled out
                                    because the passage does not mention economic control over property and land. Choice
                                    B is the best answer because it captures the definition of sovereignty as supreme
                                    power or authority.</p>

                                <p class="text-muted mt-2"><strong>Answer: B</strong> - The passage focuses on
                                    collective action, organizing, and how these principles from the revolution continue
                                    to inspire movements today, as stated in the final paragraph.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">Choice A can be ruled out because the passage acknowledges
                                    the Reign
                                    of Terror had harsh methods, so it's not saying everything was positive. C can be
                                    ruled out because the passage does not go into detail about the struggles of the
                                    aristocracy and the King. D can be ruled out because the passage is not about the
                                    power of violence. B is the best answer because it captures the main focus on
                                    collective
                                    action and its ongoing inspiration.</p>

                                <p class="fw-bold">10. The passage describes how the revolution's legacy "continues to

                                    "history is made not by kings and aristocrats alone, but by the collective action of
                                    organized people fighting for their rights and dignity." Why does the author
                                    emphasize this connection between the French Revolution and contemporary movements?

                                <p class="text-muted mt-2"><strong>Answer: B</strong> - The author explicitly states
                                    that the revolution's legacy "continues to inspire" modern movements, showing the
                                    connection between historical and contemporary organizing, which supports the
                                    passage's theme about the power of collective action.</p>
                                <p class="text-muted mt-2">This is a difficult author's purpose question because you
                                    have
                                    to understand why the author is making this connection to modern times. A can be
                                    ruled out because the passage doesn't say modern unions should use the same methods-
                                    it just says the principles continue to inspire. C can be ruled out because the
                                    passage doesn't say it was the ONLY example- it says it's an example that continues
                                    to inspire. D can be ruled out because it is in opposition to the passage's theme
                                    about the power of collective action.
                                    B is the best answer because it captures what the passage explicitly states about
                                    the
                                    legacy continuing to inspire, and connects it to the broader theme about organized
                                    people having power. </p>
